Customize memory settings based on your needs:

```
Tell Cline: "Configure memory settings for a large project"
```

## 🔧 Memory Management Commands

### **View Memory Status**
```
Tell Cline: "Show memory management status"
```
- View cache performance and memory usage
- See hit rates and file statistics
- Monitor system memory consumption

### **Optimize for Project Size**

**For Small Projects (<1k files):**
```
Tell Cline: "Optimize memory for small project"
```

**For Large Projects (10k+ files):**
```
Tell Cline: "Optimize memory for large enterprise project"
```

**For Memory-Constrained Systems:**
```
Tell Cline: "Configure conservative memory settings"
```

### **Force Cleanup**
```
Tell Cline: "Force memory cleanup"
```
- Immediately free cache memory

```

## 🎛️ Advanced Configuration

### **Manual Configuration**
You can also manually configure memory settings through the tool:

```typescript
// Example configuration for different scenarios
{
    "maxCacheSize": 1024,        // 1GB cache for large projects
    "streamThreshold": 2,        // Stream files > 2MB
    "cleanupThreshold": 85       // Cleanup at 85% memory usage
}
```

### **Environment-Specific Settings**

**Development Machine (High RAM):**
- Cache Size: 1-2GB
- Stream Threshold: 5MB
- Cleanup Threshold: 90%

**Laptop/Constrained Environment:**
- Cache Size: 256-512MB
- Stream Threshold: 1MB
- Cleanup Threshold: 70%

**Enterprise/Large Codebases:**
- Cache Size: 2GB+
- Stream Threshold: 10MB
- Cleanup Threshold: 85%

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### **Real-Time Statistics**
Monitor your optimization impact:

- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >85%
- **Memory Usage**: Keep under system limits
- **File Access Speed**: 3-10x improvement
- **Large File Handling**: Seamless 50MB+ support

### **Performance Dashboard**

## 🔄 Migration from Standard Cline

### **Upgrading**
1. **Uninstall** the standard Cline extension
2. **Install** this memory-optimized version
3. **Restart VSCode**
4. **Enable memory optimizations** on first use

### **Settings Preservation**
- All your existing settings are preserved
- API keys and configurations remain intact

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **High Memory Usage**
If you experience high memory usage:
1. Run: "Show memory management status"
2. Check cache size and hit rate
3. Consider reducing cache size
4. Force cleanup if needed

### **Slow Performance**
If performance is slower than expected:
1. Ensure memory optimizations are enabled
2. Check cache hit rate (should be >80%)
3. Monitor for memory pressure
4. Adjust settings for your system

### **Installation Issues**
If installation fails:
1. Ensure VSCode is updated to latest version
2. Try installing from command line
3. Check available disk space
4. Restart VSCode and try again

### **Memory Optimization Not Working**
If optimizations seem inactive:
1. Enable memory optimizations explicitly
2. Check VSCode console for errors
3. Restart VSCode
4. Verify installation completed successfully
